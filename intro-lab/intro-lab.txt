This file goes with part 8 of the first lab.  The idea is to give you
some practice thinking about the names of functions.  The problem is a
simple one, so we're going the software equivalent of shooting a fly
with an elephant gun, but because the problem is so simple, it makes
it easy to have a short practice session.

Here is the problem:

  - Suggest three different functions that might be useful in
    implementing `brightness`.

  - For each function, suggest three possible names.

  - For each function, say which name you think is most appropriate
    and *why*.



Function #1:

  Job: Read file input from command line

  Candidate names: read_file, open_file, get_file

  Best name: get_file

  Why the given name is the best: All this function does is take 
                                  the command line arguments and create
                                  a file pointer that can be processed
                                  later.





Function #2:

  Job: Iterate through each pixel and add brightness to an integer and 
       divide that integer by total number of pixels

  Candidate names: process_image, calculate_brightness, iterate_pixels

  Best name: calculate_brightness

  Why the given name is the best: This function will determine the solution
                                  of this problem, which is finding the 
                                  brightness of the image.





Function #3:

  Job: Print and format result and other additional data

  Candidate names: print_result, display_result, result_format

  Best name: print_result

  Why the given name is the best: This function will give the user an
                                  intuitive look at the work that this 
                                  program calculated.
