TECHNIQUE

---------------

From the beginning to end of this assignment, we consistently used paper to 
draw out each concept we were envisioning. This proved to be the most effective
method of communication between two people doing pair programming.

While we drew diagrams out, we always tried to break the bigger problems of the
assignment down to smaller concepts in the world of ideas. For example, before 
adding any code to our unblackedges file, we always drew out a small bitmap on 
paper and emulated our code line-by-line as we iterate through the image. For 
Sudoku, we drew out correct/incorrect puzzles and, on paper, iterated through
each row, column, and box finding sums and duplicate numbers. After deciding on
an algorithm verbally, only then did we turn to the computer to start writing
our code.
